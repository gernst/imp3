IMP3 - Translating imperative programs to TVLA3
===============================================

TVLA (<http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tvla/>) is a parametric shape analysis tool that
can prove properties about heap-manipulating programs. It has a rather low-level
input syntax. The `imp3c` compiler translates high-level while-programs into the
transition systems of TVLA.
